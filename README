(Pull Request [not only on safety topic] are of course welcomed)


Database:
Initialize the database running the following in the db/ folder
$> cd db; rm db; touch db && chmod 666 db && sqlite3 db
sqlite> .read schema.sql
This gives you the database schema; filling it is up to you.
(You can safely ignore: 'Error: cannot open "../custom/db/custom_values.sql"')

Customization:
As default, the following are loaded (errors can safely be ignored)
- The SQLite schema (db/schema.sql -> db/values.sql) includes custom/db/values.sql
- A favicon may be placed in custom/favicon.png

If you want to add ingredients or even a language,
you may want to edit the schema.sql and submit a pull request.
